However, because of the high costs associated with living in the centre of London, many people search for accommodation in the suburbs.\n\nThere are 32 London boroughs, each with its own charactaristics and charm. For newcomers it can be difficult to know where to focus their search for accommodation, especially if they have diverse needs such as entertainment, parks, and good schools for their children.\n\nThere is a need amongst newcomers to London to better understand the different boroughs so that they can make an informed decision when choosing an area in which to live and raise children. The target audience would be families that include children, who would be interested in this topic because they are keen to understand not only the vibe of each borough, but also the quality of local schools.",
